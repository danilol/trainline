Hi Danilo

thanks again for the pleasant conversation. 

As I mentioned here comes a test project we kindly ask you to solve:

https://gist.github.com/jonathonbellew-lp/68fca019a68e630c186e4030b8436f91


Please share your project once finished with our Head of Engineering Jonathon Bellew https://github.com/jonathonbellew-lp      

and with Marc Diehmann, our Team Lead Lead Software Development https://github.com/bench-marc 

The challenge is to do this test without any help from us, so if you have any concerns - that`s part of the assessment.
But if you struggle too hard, let me know, I have a small hint that maybe helps.

Please submit the test via Greenhouse (just add a quick note with your GitHub profile after adding the Hiring Managers to it) when you are finished and I´ll present it to the Hiring Managers. You can find this link at the bottom of this email.

I´ll try to come back to you as soon as I can with his opinion.

The deadline for this test would be 2 weeks. Please let me know if you need more time.

I wish you all the best & regards

Nora Mosig
